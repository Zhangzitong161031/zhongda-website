In 2015, as a compulsory responding company for the US antidumping and countervailing case against metal shelves in China, we actively cooperated with the US Department of Commerce to conduct on-the-spot investigations and obtained a good tax rate. In 2016, we actively responded to Australia's antidumping and countervailing against Chinese metal shelves; the result was “with no damage”. In 2018, while facing with a new antidumping and countervailing case against China's metal shelves from the US, we submitted a review of the qualifications for prosecution before the official filing, our products were successfully excluded in the end.</p><p>Our current business is mainly divided into two parts: heavy industry and light industry.

Our customers are mainly the major hardware tools supermarkets in the world. Among the above products, the export of medium-sized shelves is in a leading position in China.</p><p>While maintaining the interests of our customers, we actively create our own brand. This year, we registered two corporate trademarks “BAAB ORGANIZING” and “BAAB FASTENER” for storage products and fasteners; “BAAB” is a transliteration for our hometown “Bai Bu”, ‘Bai Bu” is where all our business began, with our brand goes abroad and we become an international comprehensive company, we will always remember where we came from and we root in “Bai Bu”.</p>",
